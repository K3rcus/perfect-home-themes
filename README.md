# Perfect Home - Themes

This is the place where you can find (and contribute your own) themes for the [Perfect Home](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/perfect-home) firefox addon.

## What is a Theme?
It's basically a folder in this repo, containing one or more of these:
- Thumbnails for websites - any number and any website.
- Custom CSS - that one can just copy & paste in settings and it will change the look & feel of the Perfect Home page.

## Contribution rules
In addition to the above, a Theme should also have:
- Unique name (obviously, as it's a folder). If you wish, you can add namespace in a format: `tom123-mytheme` or even nest themes (if you plan to add more than one), so we have `tom123/mytheme`
- A nice screenshot, showing off the customizations.
- A good description (e.g. `README.md` file) ideally with that screenshot.
- Author's contact details (email/github username), so when something doesn't work, people know who to ask.
- For future updates and contribution - you can include a template/file from the graphical application you've used (e.g. Sketch, Figma, Powerpoint)

You can have a look at the sample themes that are already in the repo.
Once we have a decent number, I will think about some gallery website :smile:.


The ultimate plan is to hook this repo to the extension, so you can just select a theme directly from there!
